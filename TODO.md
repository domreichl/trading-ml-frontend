## TODO
1. finish visualization in performance.py and dashboard.py when all models are developed
2. visualize trading performance in trades.py
3. complete backtests.py
4. confusion matrix for sign predictions
5. add error bars (research how to best compute them with ML models)
6. weekly update of data for visualizations with auto-commits to prevent the app from going to sleep
