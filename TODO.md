## TODO
0. upate all data sources
1. finish backtests.py
2. finish visualizations when all models are deployed:
    - https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/style.html
    - https://plotly.com/python/plotly-express/
    - trades.py, performance.py, dashboard.py
    - confusion matrix for sign predictions
    - box plots for trading performance (median, min, max values)
    - add error bars (research how to best compute them with ML models)
3. weekly update of data for visualizations with auto-commits to prevent the app from going to sleep
