## TODO
1. visualize trading performance in trades.py
2. update visualization in performance.py and dashboard.py when all models are developed
3. finish visualizations:
    - https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/style.html
    - https://plotly.com/python/plotly-express/
    - backtests.py
    - confusion matrix for sign predictions
    - add error bars (research how to best compute them with ML models)
4. weekly update of data for visualizations with auto-commits to prevent the app from going to sleep
